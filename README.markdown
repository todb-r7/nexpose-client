## Contributions

We welcome contributions to this package.

Our coding standards include:

* Favor returning classes over key-value maps. Classes tend to be easier for users to manipulate and use.
* Unless otherwise noted, code should adhere to the Ruby Style Guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
* Use YARDoc comment style to improve the API documentation of the gem.
